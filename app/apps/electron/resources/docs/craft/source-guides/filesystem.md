# Filesystem


Local filesystem sources provide direct access to directories on your machine. Use them to connect:

*   **Code repositories** - Browse and work with local Git repos
*   **Note vaults** - Obsidian vaults, Logseq graphs, Zettelkasten folders
*   **Project folders** - Design files, documents, data directories
*   **Config directories** - Dotfiles, application settings

## How It Works

Filesystem sources are **direct bookmarks** to local directories. Unlike MCP servers, they don’t require running external processes—Craft Agent accesses files directly through its built-in file tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep).

When you create a filesystem source, you’re telling Craft Agent: “This folder is important—treat it as a named source I can reference.”

## Key Concepts

### Path Scope

Each source points to a single directory. All file operations are scoped to that path and its subdirectories.

### Source Context

When active, the source’s `guide.md` is loaded into context, helping Craft Agent understand:

*   What the directory contains
*   How to navigate the structure
*   Any special conventions or patterns

### Permissions

In Explore mode, only read operations are allowed (Read, Glob, Grep). Write and Edit require Ask to Edit or Execute mode.

## Setup Guide

### Configuration

**Required config.json:**

```json
{
  "name": "My Project",
  "slug": "my-project",
  "enabled": true,
  "provider": "filesystem",
  "type": "local",
  "icon": "📁",
  "tagline": "Local project files and documentation",
  "local": {
    "path": "/Users/you/Projects/my-project"
  }
}
```

Caution

The `path` must be an **absolute path** to an existing directory. Use `~` expansion or full paths like `/Users/you/...`

### Recommended Questions

*   Which directory do you want to connect?
*   What does this directory contain? (code, notes, data, etc.)
*   How is it organized? (any special folder structure)

### Example: Obsidian Vault

```json
{
  "name": "Personal Vault",
  "slug": "personal-vault",
  "enabled": true,
  "provider": "obsidian",
  "type": "local",
  "icon": "https://obsidian.md/favicon.ico",
  "tagline": "Personal notes, journals, and knowledge base",
  "local": {
    "path": "/Users/you/Documents/ObsidianVault"
  }
}
```

### Example: GitHub Repository

```json
{
  "name": "My App",
  "slug": "my-app",
  "enabled": true,
  "provider": "github",
  "type": "local",
  "icon": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg",
  "tagline": "iOS app source code and documentation",
  "local": {
    "path": "/Users/you/Developer/my-app"
  }
}
```

### Permissions for Explore Mode

Filesystem sources use Bash patterns for Explore mode permissions:

```json
{
  "allowedBashPatterns": [
    { "pattern": "^(ls|cat|head|tail|grep|find|tree)\\s", "comment": "Read-only file commands" }
  ]
}
```

Note

Built-in file tools (Read, Glob, Grep) are always allowed in Explore mode. Bash patterns are only needed if you want to allow specific shell commands.

### No Authentication Required

Local sources access files directly—no API keys, tokens, or OAuth needed.
