# Memory

Persistent key-value storage and knowledge graph for maintaining context across sessions.

## Capabilities

*   **Store entities** - Save named entities with observations
*   **Create relations** - Link entities together
*   **Query knowledge** - Retrieve stored information
*   **Persistent storage** - Data persists between sessions

## Guidelines

*   Useful for remembering user preferences, project context
*   Entities have names and lists of observations
*   Relations connect entities (e.g., “project X uses technology Y”)
*   Storage is local to the machine

## Setup Guide

Note

This is a **local stdio MCP server** with no external dependencies.

### Configuration

**Required config.json:**

```json
{
  "name": "Memory",

  "mcp": {
    "transport": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
  }
}
```

### Recommended Questions

*   What kind of information do you want to persist? (preferences, project notes, etc.)
*   Should this be shared across workspaces or specific to one?
