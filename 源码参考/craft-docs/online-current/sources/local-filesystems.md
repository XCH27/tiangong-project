# Local Folders

> Bookmark folders on your machine for quick access and documentation

Local folders are bookmarks to directories on your machine. They provide a named reference that appears in your sources list, with optional documentation via `guide.md`.

<Note>
  **No special setup required.** Local folders use the same Read, Write, Glob, and Grep tools that work on any path. The value is organization and documentation.

## When to Use Local Folders

| Need                                     | Solution                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Work in a single project directory       | Use [Working Directory](/docs/core-concepts/working-directory) |
| Bookmark multiple folders                | Use Local Folders                                         |
| Document folder contents and conventions | Use Local Folders with guide.md                           |

## Configuration

Create a source folder with a `config.json`:

```json theme={null}
{
  "type": "local",
  "name": "My Notes",
  "slug": "my-notes",
  "enabled": true,
  "provider": "local",
  "local": {
    "path": "/Users/me/Documents/Notes"
  }
}
```

### Fields

| Field        | Description                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `type`       | Must be `"local"`                         |
| `name`       | Display name in sources list              |
| `slug`       | URL-safe identifier (used as folder name) |
| `enabled`    | Whether the source is active              |
| `provider`   | Service identifier, use `"local"`         |
| `local.path` | Absolute path to the folder               |

### Optional: Format Hint

You can add a format hint to help your agent understand the folder contents:

```json theme={null}
{
  "type": "local",
  "name": "Obsidian Vault",
  "slug": "my-vault",
  "provider": "obsidian",
  "local": {
    "path": "/Users/me/Documents/ObsidianVault",
    "format": "obsidian"
  }
}
```

## Adding a Local Folder

The easiest way is to ask your agent:

> "Add my Desktop folder as a source"

Or create manually:

1. Create the source folder:
   ```
   ~/.craft-agent/workspaces/{workspace-id}/sources/my-folder/
   ```

2. Add `config.json` with the configuration above

3. Optionally add `guide.md` with context about the folder

## guide.md Example

The guide helps your agent understand what's in the folder and how to use it:

```markdown theme={null}
# Desktop

Temporary files and downloads. Check here for recent screenshots and exports.

## Contents
- Screenshots from CMD+Shift+4
- Downloaded PDFs and documents
- Temporary exports from apps

## Conventions
- Screenshots go in /Screenshots subfolder
- Delete files older than 1 week
- Don't commit anything from here to git
```

## Explore Mode Permissions

By default, local folders work in Explore mode with the standard read-only bash commands (ls, cat, head, tail, etc.).

To customize, add `permissions.json`:

```json theme={null}
{
  "allowedBashPatterns": [
    { "pattern": "^ls\\s", "comment": "List contents" },
    { "pattern": "^tree\\s", "comment": "Show directory tree" }
  ]
}
```

## Local Folders vs Working Directory

Choose the right approach for your use case:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Working Directory" icon="folder-open">
    Your **active project**. Set once per session. Full tool access for coding, building, and testing.

    Use for: The project you're currently working on
  </Card>

  <Card title="Local Folders" icon="bookmark">
    **Bookmarks** to folders you reference occasionally. Named sources with documentation.

    Use for: Notes, downloads, reference materials
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Rule of thumb:** Use Working Directory for coding. Use Local Folders for everything else.
